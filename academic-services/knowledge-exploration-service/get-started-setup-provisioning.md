## Create an Azure subscription and storage account to receive MAKES API builds

### [Create an Azure Subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/get-started)

Please create a new Azure subscription for the distribution previews. If your organization already has an Azure account, this can be a separate subscription under the same tenant id. If you start from scratch, for example “create Azure free account”, the subscription will be created under a new tenant id.

### [Create an Azure Storage Account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-quickstart-create-account?tabs=portal)

1. **Home > Create a resource > Storage > Storage account**

    ![Create new azure storage account](media/create-azure-storage-account.png "Create new azure storage account")

2. Specify the following settings:

    | Setting | Value |
    | --------| ----- |
    | Account Name | makesas<org_name> |
    | Account kind | Select **StorageV2** |
    | Replication | Select **LRS** |
    | Performance | Select **Standard** |
    | Resource Group | Enter **makes** |

    ![Configure azure storage account details](media/create-azure-storage-account-configure.png "Configure azure storage account details")

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > You don’t need to use your organization name after the “makesas”, however the account name must be unique among all Azure Storage Accounts

    > [!NOTE]
    > Select whatever region is most appropriate for your existing Azure resources

3. Once notified that the storage account has been created, click “go to resource”

    ![Go to new azure storage account](media/create-azure-storage-account-go-to.png "Go to new azure storage account")

4. Go to “access keys” and take note of the “storage account name” and the “primary key”

    ![Copy new azure storage account details](media/create-azure-storage-account-copy-details.png "Copy new azure storage account details")

5. To sign up for the MAKES API distribution preview, send the following details to <a href="mailto:academicapi@microsoft.com?subject=Access request to Microsoft Academic Knowledge Exploration Service (MAKES) distribution preview">academicapi@microsoft.com</a> with the subject "Access request to Microsoft Academic Knowledge Exploration Service (MAKES) distribution preview":

    - Are you affiliated with a company or university?
        - If company, please provide the company’s name, your department/group and your role
        - If university, please provide the university’s name, department, group/advisor, and your role (undergraduate student, grad student, professor, etc.)
    - Brief description of the project you will be using MAKES for
    - Name of your Microsoft sales representative, if you have one
    - Azure storage account name
    - Azure storage account primary access key
    - Do you want a single, one-time provision of the most recent release, or recurring provisions whenever a new release is available?

    > [!NOTE]
    > MAKES is currently in a free preview period, so there are no charges associated with the provisioning or use of data/service itself. However Azure requires you to cover all costs associated with standard resource creation, usage, etc. For cost estimates associated with MAKES please see the [Pricing](resources-pricing.md) page. <br/><br/>Most research institutions have an "Enterprise Account" with Microsoft including Azure subscription. The pricing for Enterprise Accounts differ from the individual account shown in Azure's price calculator. <br/><br/>If you have an Enterprise Account, please check with your individual institution's Information Technology/Computer Center resource on the process of setting up Azure to get MAKES. You might need to obtain a "Master Agreement #" and involve MLSP (Microsoft Licensed Solution Provider) for help.

## API release process

MAKES API builds are deployed approximately once a week to the Azure storage account that were used to signed up for the distribution preview.

Each API build has a unique name reflecting the date it was created, and is placed in the following location inside the storage account:

makes(storage account container)
  - YYYY-MM-DD (release date)
    - index
      - makes-YYYY-MM-DD-prod-index#.kes
    - grammar
      - makes-default-grammar
    - tools
      - indexer.zip
      - preprocessor.zip
      - jobManager.zip
      - kesm.zip
    - webhost
      - makes-service-host.zip
    - License.docx
