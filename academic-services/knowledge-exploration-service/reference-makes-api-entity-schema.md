# Entity schema

The academic graph is composed of 7 types of entity. All entities will have an Entity ID and an Entity type.

## Common Entity Attributes

Name    |Description    |Type    | Operations
------- | ------------- | -------| ---------------
Id      |Entity ID      |Int64   |Equals
Ty      |Entity type    |enum    |Equals

### Entity type enum

Name    |value
--------|-------
[Paper](#paper-entity) |0
[Author](#author-entity) |1
[Journal](#journal-entity) |2
[Conference Series](#conference-series-entity) |3
[Conference Instance](#conference-instance-entity) |4
[Affiliation](#affiliation-entity) |5
[Field Of Study](#field-of-study-entity) |6

### Paper Entity Extended

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This attribute has been deprecated and is only supported for legacy applications. Requesting this attribute individually (i.e. attributes=Id,Ti,E) will result in all extended metadata attributes being returned in a *serialized JSON string*</br></br>All attributes contained in the extended metadata are now available as a top-level attribute and can be requested as such (i.e. attributes=Id,Ti,DOI,IA)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Support for requesting individual extended attributes by using the "E." scope, i.e. "E.DN" is being deprecated. While this is still technically supported, requesting individual extended attributes using the "E." scope will result in the attribute value being returned in two places in the JSON response, as part of the "E" object and as a top level attribute.

[Stop words](https://academic.microsoft.com/topic/188338183) are an [Information Retrieval](https://academic.microsoft.com/topic/23123220) concept where words that are common to a given corpus are removed from consideration for activities such as search. 

The list of stop words used by MAKES is based off the [Inverse Document Frequency](https://academic.microsoft.com/topic/81758059) of words across the academic corpus.
